# Project background
TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
TikTokâ€™s data team is in the earliest stages of the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

# A- STAGE ONE

1- Organize project tasks into milestones.

2- Classify tasks using the PACE workflow.

3- Identify relevant stakeholders.
```

# A- STAGE TWO
